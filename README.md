### MODULE 1
### Lesson 1: Motivation
* **What I Learned:** This was an introductory lesson covering the core motivation for LangGraph. It explained why managing state and creating cycles (loops) is crucial for building complex agents, and how LangGraph is designed to solve these challenges where standard chains might fall short.
* **My Code Tweak:** No coding was done in this lesson as it was purely conceptual.
* **Source File:** All my work will be saved in the `my_learnings` directory, following the module structure.
